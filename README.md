 Garage-Management-System

The Garage Management CRM is a custom-built solution developed on the Salesforce platform to modernize and automate vehicle servicing operations. The system centralizes critical garage functions such as “customer management”, “appointment scheduling”, “vehicle tracking”, and “service history maintenance”. It enables garage staff to efficiently handle mechanic assignments, service requests, billing, and customer feedback in one place. By using “custom objects”, “flows”, and “validation rules”, the CRM reduces manual workload and increases operational accuracy.
	Automation is a key strength of the system, with features like “automatic service record creation”, “billing updates”, and “email notifications” triggered through flows. Role-based access control ensures that data is securely handled by the right users, such as Managers and Salespersons. The CRM also supports decision-making through “real-time reports and dashboards”, offering insights into customer satisfaction, billing status, and service trends. The user interface is intuitive and tailored using Lightning App Builder with dynamic layouts. Ultimately, the system transforms traditional paper-based workflows into an efficient, digital-first process that improves both service delivery and business growth.
